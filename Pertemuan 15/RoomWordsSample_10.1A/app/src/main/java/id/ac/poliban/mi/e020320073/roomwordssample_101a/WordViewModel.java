 *                                                  ViewModel
 *
 * A ViewModel holds your app's UI data in a way that survives configuration changes. Separating your app's UI data from your Activity and Fragment
 * classes lets you better follow the single responsibility principle: Your activities and fragments are responsible for drawing data to the screen,
 * while your ViewModel is responsible for holding and processing all the data needed for the UI.
 *
 * The WordViewModel hides everything about the backend from the user interface. It provides methods for accessing the UI data, and it returns LiveData
 * so that MainActivity can set up the observer relationship. Views, activities, and fragments only interact with the data through the ViewModel.
 * As such, it doesn't matter where the data comes from.
